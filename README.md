Implementation of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for molecular geometry optimization using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). This repository contains the Jupyter notebook codes and results for my thesis on molecule optimization via VQE.

## Overview

This project explores the integration of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with classical optimization methods for molecular geometry optimization. The framework supports both Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory (DFT) initialization and demonstrates applications to small molecular systems (H₂ and H₃⁺).
